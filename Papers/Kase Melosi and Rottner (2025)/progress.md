Plan For today

1. Implement the particle filter both for the NK and NK NN model. 
2. Get started on the RANK Model


## First Coding Session 11:40 am to 1 pm
I failed to make much progress today. 

Lessons Today
1. Don't use revise in the hope of quick edits. Its actually slows down as sometimes it just fails to update the function defintions. Old Jupyter notebooks or just simply using the include is much better. 
2. Don't try to over complicate the training function. Keep it simple, if it has to work. the simple training function should work. 
3. Try to look at the policy of Neural Network after its being trained. To see what are its predictions. Always as Jeremy says do iterative step by step example debugging. 
4. Progress but at what cost, really? What do you actually want to achieve through this?

Note: Finally, it worked at the end of the day, although I have to review my results and see.

1. Go through the particle filter code
   1. Go through the Python File Run it Line by Line and see if I understand it. 
   2. Do it both for Filters
   3. And then run it on the Julia File
